## Background


As a new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, there was responsiblity for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. City officials expected the generation of regular reports to publicize and improve the city program. 

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. 



## Objective


Although data has been regularly updated, the team has not implemented a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. The first task is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.
